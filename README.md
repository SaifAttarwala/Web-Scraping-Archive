# Web-Scraping-Archive
Just includes my software which I have written while learning and making simple web scrapers. 
Do note that it might be depreciated or broken at some point because I will not update archival releases

Beautiful Soup Alpha:
  My first scraper, it is a very simple project which parses a job site and filters data by the criteria of "Posted few days ago"

Selenium Alpha:
  I learnt more on scraping dynamic pages while using drivers and automations. I scraped on tripadvisor to find local restaurants, parse all top listed restaurants 
  (30 as of now) and jot down information like name, rank, ratings, phone number, address, cuisine and prices. After all the data is parsed and collected,
  it stores it perfectly in a CSV file.
